# Requirements

In this task, we want to analyse the performance of ridge regression in the given feature space and estimate the optimal regularisation parameter. To achieve the task, you will need to implement ridge regression and evaluate its performance on the training as well on an independent test set. You will also have to analyse these performance metrics and discuss the choice of the regularisation parameter and its relation to under- and over-fitting.
