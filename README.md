# Ridge Regression - Assignment 1
# Requirements
# Task 1
In this task, we want to analyse the performance of ridge regression in the given feature space and estimate the optimal regularisation parameter. To achieve the task, you will need to implement ridge regression and evaluate its performance on the training as well on an independent test set. You will also have to analyse these performance metrics and discuss the choice of the regularisation parameter and its relation to under- and over-fitting.
# Task 2
In this task, several data for a specific plant have been collected. The data include four features, which are stem length, stem diameter, leaf length, and leaf width (in cm) of this plant. The purpose of this experiment is to figure out whether these features could be used to cluster the plants into 3 groups. Therefore, you are asked to make a clustering analysis over the data, which will help the plant biologists to understand their experimental results. 

# Artificial Neural Network - Assignment 2
# Requirements
# Task 1
The objective of this assignment is to analyse a dataset concerning nuclear reactor data, specifically on fuel assemblies cluster vibrations, alterations of thermal-hydraulic parameters, etc. For over half a century, the nuclear industry – in the UK and worldwide - has primarily focused on the technological evolution of reliable nuclear power plants to produce electricity. By monitoring nuclear reactors while running at nominal conditions, it is possible to gather valuable insight for early detection of anomalies. Various types of fluctuations can be caused by the turbulent nature of flow in the core, mechanical vibrations within the reactor, the boiling coolant and stochastic character (random noise). The dataset can be downloaded from Blackboard. It is based on data from a research project that investigates how to detect various anomalies in nuclear reactors. The dataset includes two classes (normal/abnormal condition) and a number of features, which will need to be summarised.  The class membership of each row is stored in the field ‘Status’. Our task is to develop a set of classification models for automatically classifying reactors as normal or abnormal, based on their parameters/features
